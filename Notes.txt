Routing

Routing Means Matching Different URLs to Different Views in the USER Interface

for example : 
showing Home Page when visits our application 
- www.globepin.com/

showing login page  when user visits - www.globepin.com/login

This enables users to navigate between different applications screens, using the browser URLs

Keeps the UI in Sync with the current browser URLs
